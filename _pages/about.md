I am a Visiting Assistant Professor of Political Science at [Washington & Jefferson College (W&J)]( https://www.washjeff.edu/) in southwest Pennsylvania. I earned my Ph.D. in Political Science from [the University of Kansas (KU)](https://kups.ku.edu/). 
 
My research sits at the intersection of domestic politics and international relations, with a substantive focus on US-China relations, Africa-China relations, and Chinese politics and society. I am also interested in policy evaluation and public policy. My work has been published or is forthcoming in _Democratization_, _Business and Politics_, _The Journal of Modern African Studies_, _Journal of Chinese Governance_, _Japanese Journal of Political Science_, _Social Indicators Research_,
_International Political Science Review_,and other outlets.

My teaching expertise encompasses introductory courses in International Relations, Comparative Politics, and Research Methods, as well as upper-level courses in International Political Economy, East Asian Politics, Chinese Politics and Policy, US-China Relations, Chinaâ€“Africa Relations, and Research Methods.
