 I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at [The University of Kansas(KU)](https://kups.ku.edu/), studying in Comparative Politics and International Relations with a minor in Political Methodology. I was a Doctoral Research Fellow at [Institute for Policy & Social Research](https://ipsr.ku.edu/) in 2022-2023. I plan to defend my dissertation in the spring of 2025, and I am on the 2024-25 job market.

My research sits at the intersection of domestic politics and international relations, with a substantive focus on US-China relations, Africa-China relations, and Chinese politics and society. I am also interested in policy evaluation and public policy. My work has been published or is forthcoming in _Democratization_, _Business and Politics_, _The Journal of Modern African Studies_, _Journal of Chinese Governance_, _Japanese Journal of Political Science_, _Social Indicators Research_, _ International Political Science Review_,and other outlets.

My dissertation project investigates the transition from class identity to national identity and the rising Chinese nationalism in the post-Mao era. I focus on how social, economic, and political factors influence nationalism, and how national superiority increases citizens'support for government redistribution, with heterogeneous effects driven by ideology and self-interest.
