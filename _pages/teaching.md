At KU, I have gained valuable experience by serving as a teaching assistant, a guest lecturer and as a student research mentor. I am prepared to teach introductory level courses on International Relations, Comparative Politics, and Research Methods. I am excited to offer a wide range of upper-level courses in my areas of expertise, such as East Asian Politics, Chinese Domestic and Foreign Policy, China-Africa Relations, Political Economy, Research Design, and Quantitative and Qualitative Methods. I am also prepared to mentor undergraduate and graduate students with an open-door policy.
